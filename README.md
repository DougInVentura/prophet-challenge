# prophet-challenge
Note: Homework due Feb 7th
Submitted by Doug Francis on Feb 7th.

The completed source code for this project is in this repo at "prophet-challenge\M8_Starter_Code\forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb"

In this challenge, we analyzed data from MercadoLibre (http://investor.mercadolibre.com/about-us). With over 200 million users, MercadoLibre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. We were tasked with analyzing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to see if Google searche volume correlated with stock data. We wanted to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

The instructions for this Challenge are divided into four steps, as follows:

* Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic

* Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality

* Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns

* Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet
